# 352_assignment1

I used Python version 3.13.5. To run the code, I used python3 as opposed to python listed for commands on the assignment doc (the rest of the command is the same as the assignment doc).

The files that are included are Heuristics.py, puzzleGenerator.py, formatCheck.py, puzzleSolver.py, TileProblem.py. there should be a file with the puzzle to be solved that is inputted when running puzzleSolver, as mentioned in the assignment doc.
